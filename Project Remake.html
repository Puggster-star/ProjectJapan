                    <pre><h3>Japan is a very unique and amazing place. Japan is located in East Asia in which they speak japanese. Some people actually call the location
of Japan the "ring of fire" because it is one of the most tectonically active places on earth. They are well known for many things such as
vending machines, cherry blossoms, tea ceremonies, Mount Fuji, Shinkansen, sumo wrestling, video games, technology and gadgets, Shinto
Religion, samurai and ninjas, futuristic toilets, punctuality, sake, Godzilla, manga and anime, and origami. Their are over 5.5 million
vending machines in Japan, a country with a population of 125.7 million. Cherry Blossoms are a beautiful tree that blooms best in the
spring. The most common is the Yoshino Cherry which has oval-shaped petals that change from pale pink to white. Tea ceremonies
play a big part of Japanese culture. Usually when the tea is served there is casual chatting about seasonal changing but in the
preparation phase participants keep quite. This is why a tea ceremony falls under the category of meditational activity.
During these tea ceremonies the host makes tea and serves it to the guests but the host does not drink it because the whole
ceremonyis for the pleasure of the guests. "The procedure of Japanese tea ceremony steps is called temae in Japanese."
There are two different types of tea ceremonies, which are the chakai, and the chaji. The chakai is a typical
informal tea ceremony that lasts around 45 minutes. This is crazy because the training takes years. The chaji is a 
formal tea ceremony that senior tea masters participate in and the service of traditional kaiseki meals which can 
last up to 4 hours. </h3></pre>

                    <h1>Government</h1>
                    <pre><h3> Japan is a very unique country but it's government is more similar to ours than you would think. They have a parliamentary constitutional 
monarchy. Basically that is a system of government where a monarch shares power with an elected parliament. The monarch is the head of state 
and the prime minister leads the government. Also alike us Japan has a constitution called "日本國憲法" which translates to Japanese 
Constitution. This constitution was written 1946 and adopted in 1947. In Japan also has a system of checks and balances which was introduced 
in 1889. They also have three branches which are the Legislative, Executive and Judicial. The Executive is the chief of state, 
head of government and cabinet just like the United States. The upper Legislative branch has the House of Councillors and the 
lower is the house of reps. The judicial branch is the supreme court also known as Saiko saibansho. Japan is not representative. 
When it comes to electing people in the government it is very different than the way that the United States does their 
elections. In the Japanese electoral system the prime minister is nominated by both houses of the Diet. The National Diet 
is composed of the House of Representatives and House of Councillors. Each conducts a ballot and if the two houses 
choose different individuals then a committee of both houses is appointed to agree on a common nominee. Then that
elected prime minister has a four year-term. The current prime minister of Japan is Shigeru Ishiba. Alike the 
United States Japan's Constitution says that citizens have a range of civil and political rights including: freedom of speech, 
assembly, religion, press and movement, the right to a fair trial, protection from slavery, the right to a private life, and 
equality under the law, with no discrimination based on race, creed, sex, social status, or family origin.   </h3> </pre>
